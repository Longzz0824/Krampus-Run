# Krampus Run!: Bavarian Theme Running Game

## Overview
In ancient times, during the long, cold, and dark winters, it was believed that evil creatures, especially the Wild Hunt, ruled. Wise humans dressed in fur and animal skins to appear scary, and they attached bells and chains to themselves to make noise and scare away these creatures. They wanted to trick them into thinking there were ghosts here too.

## Game Genre
**Running Game**

## Game Scenario
The village has a story that says there are still bad creatures hiding in the forest close by. A brave young man decides to venture forth and uncover the truth. Upon entering the forest, he encounters various monsters, requiring him to acquire different items to gain diverse abilities, ensuring his survival as much as possible.

## Vision
### Game Mechanics
- Players encounter various demons along their journey.
- They can either evade them or acquire items to gain special abilities.
- When encountering monsters, they will lose some health until they are defeated.
- The player with the longest survival time will receive the highest score.

### Concept Art
- A sense of danger and terror will be a key theme in the visuals.

## Inspiration
The game draws inspiration from several successful titles:
- **Subway Surfers** and **Temple Run**: Endless runner games where players dodge obstacles and collect power-ups while automatically running through various environments.
- **Arrow a Row**: A casual parkour-like game with endless and replayable levels where players shoot down enemies with arrows.
